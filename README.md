# EV-Communication-System
IoT based Electric Vehicle Communication System
The purpose is to design lane detection adas feature for electric vehicle and communicate the parameters or factors with the user located at long distance using MQTT protocol.
The lane detection code is taken from https://github.com/canozcivelek/lane-detection-with-steer-and-departure which is mostly dependent on Computer Vision(CV2) library of Python. 
The only change is made is that to communicate this data using MQTT protocol.
